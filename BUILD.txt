To build the pdf, simply run on your favourite shell:

$ xelatex Ã¤quivalenzen.tex

Note that you might want to install the texlive-math-extra package. On Debian, this is:

$ sudo aptitude install texlive-math-extra

To add new (counter-) examples, please stick with the same pattern 
as with the other files, and use the \svg command, which loads the 
appropiate .pdf_tex file, which in turn loads its .pdf file.

-- FIXME --
The build process dot -> svg isn't repeatable.
The build process ??? -> pdf isn't repeatable.
The build process pdf -> pdf_tex isn't repeatable.
Line 25 in header.tex is either a typo or a hint for above missing build process(es).
